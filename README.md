# Magerun-Modules
This repositor should serve as a storage for my **_n98-magerun_** (@see: https://github.com/netz98/n98-magerun) extensions I've developed.

# Installation
Just put the **_n98-magerun_** folder into your **_Magento_**'s **_lib_** folder (**_MAGENTOROOT/lib/_**).
Afterwards you should see the following additional commands in the commandlist of magerun when running

```
$> n98-magerun
```
on shell:

 - admin:user:delete:all
 - order:delete:all
 - quote:delete:all
